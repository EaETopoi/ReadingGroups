## Introduction

In these notes we review some of the important properties and tools associated with localization. Our primary reference in these notes is Atiyah[^1], which we follow closely. As it will be useful for several results in this and other notes we begin by recalling some properties of finitely generated modules.

## Finitely Generated Modules

Our first result, although esoteric in form, is incredibly important both in content and proof technique for a number of other results, so we go through it carefully.

>[!proposition] Transformational Dependence
>Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module, let $I$ be an ideal of $A$, and let $\phi:M\to M$ be an $A$-module endomorphism such that $\phi(M) \subseteq IM$. Then $\phi$ satisfies an equation of the form $$\phi^n+a_{n-1}\phi^{n-1}+\cdots + a_1\phi+a_0=0$$
>where the $a_i$ are in $I$.

^4f1d9d

`\begin{proof}`
This result uses what I like to colloquially call a **determinant proof technique** which comes up numerous times in arguments on integral dependence in algebraic number theory. Let $x_1,...,x_n$ be a generating set in $M$. Then for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ we have an equation $$\phi(x_i) = \sum_{j=0}^nb_{ij}x_j$$
where the $b_{ij} \in I$. Let $B = (\delta_{ij}\phi-b_{ij})_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ denote a matrix with coefficients in the endomorphism ring on $M$. Then we have $Bx_ie_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Multiplying by the adjugate of $B$ on the left we have that $\det(B)x_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$, so in particular $\det(B)$ is the zero morphism on $M$. But $B$ is a matrix with coefficients in $\phi$ and $I$ so in particular its determinant is of the form
$$\phi^n+a_{n-1}\phi^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1\phi+a_0 = 0$$
where the $a_i$ are linear combinations of the $b_{ij}$ and hence in $I$.
`\end{proof}`

This extremely general result provides us with a simple way of proving Nakayama's lemma, which we do after the following corollary:

>[!corollary]
>Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and let $I$ be an ideal of $A$ such that $IM = M$. Then there exists $x \equiv 1\mod I$ such that $xM = 0$.

^3db31f

`\begin{proof}`
Take $\phi = 1_M$ in [[Atiyah Localization#^4f1d9d]], and take $x = 1+a_{n-1}+\cdots +a_1+a_0$, so that $xM = 0$ and $x \equiv 1 \mod I$.
`\end{proof}`

>[!proposition] Nakayama's Lemma
>Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and $I$ an ideal of $A$ contained in the Jacobson radical $\mathfrak{R}$ of $A$. Then $IM = M$ implies $M = 0$.

^942eff

`\begin{proof}`
Note that if $I \subseteq \mathfrak{R}$ and $IM = M$, then $\mathfrak{R}M = M$. By [[Atiyah Localization#^3db31f]] we have $x \equiv 1 \mod \mathfrak{R}$ such that $xM = 0$. But, recall that if $x \equiv 1 \mod \mathfrak{R}$ then $x-1 \in \mathfrak{R}$. If $x$ is not a unit then $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ for some maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$. But $x-1 \in \mathfrak{R} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}$, which implies that $1 \in \mathfrak{m}$, which is impossible. Thus $x$ is a unit and $M = x^{-1}xM = 0$.
`\end{proof}`
As a simple corollary we obtain a condition for determining when a submodule is actually the full module.

>[!corollary]
>Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module, $N$ a submodule of $M$, and $I \subseteq A$ an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical of $A$. If $M = IM + N$, then $M = N$.

^635d86

`\begin{proof}`
We can apply [[Atiyah Localization#^942eff]] to $M/N$, to conclude that since $I(M/N) = (IM+N)/N = M/N$, we have $M/N = 0$, and so $M = N$.
`\end{proof}`
Suppose in addition that $A$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ and residue field $\kappa(\mathfrak{m})$. Then a finitely generated $A$-module $M$ gives a finite dimensional $\kappa(\mathfrak{m})$-vector space $M/\mathfrak{m}M$. In this setting we have the following result.

>[!proposition] Pulling back generating set
>Let $x_1,...,x_n \in M$ be a set of elements whose images in $M/\mathfrak{m}M$ form a basis of the vector space. Then $x_1,...,x_n$ generate $M$.

`\begin{proof}`
Let $N$ be the submodule of $M$ generated by the $x_i$. Then $N\to M\to M/\mathfrak{m}M$ is surjective, and hence $N+\mathfrak{m}M = M$, so $N = M$ by [[Atiyah Localization#^635d86]].
`\end{proof}`


## Localization of Modules

>[!proposition] Local Property
>Let $M$ be an $A$-module. Then the following are equivalent:
>1. $M = 0$ 
>2. $M_\mathfrak{p} = 0$ for all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$
>3. $M_\mathfrak{m} = 0$ for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$

^61edfe

`\begin{proof}`
The implications $(1)\implies (2)\implies (3)$ are immediate, so it suffices to prove $(3)\implies (1)$. Towards a contradiction suppose $M \neq 0$. Let $x \in M$ be non-zero. As $x$ is non-zero $\text{Ann}(x)$ must be proper and hence by Zorn's lemma is contained in some maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. Then as $M_\mathfrak{m} = 0$, by assumption, there exists $a \in A\backslash \mathfrak{m}$ such that $a\cdot x = 0$. But then $a \in \text{Ann}(x)$, contradicting the fact that $\text{Ann}(x) \subseteq \mathfrak{m}$. Thus, we must have $M = 0$.
`\end{proof}`

>[!corollary] Locally Injective (resp. surjective)
>If $f:M\to N$ is a map of $A$-modules, then the following are equivalent:
>1. $f:M\to N$ is injective (resp. surjective)
>2. $f_\mathfrak{p}:M_\mathfrak{p}\to N_\mathfrak{p}$ is injective (resp. surjective) for all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$
>3. $f_\mathfrak{m}:M_\mathfrak{m}\to N_\mathfrak{m}$ is injective (resp. surjective) for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$.

^191764

`\begin{proof}`
The implications $(1)\implies (2)\implies (3)$ follows since localization is an exact functor. It suffices to prove that $(3)\implies (1)$. Observe that $0\to \ker(f)\to M\to N$ is exact. Then we have for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$, $0\to \ker(f)_\mathfrak{m}\to M_\mathfrak{m}\to N_\mathfrak{m}$ is exact, which implies $\ker(f)_\mathfrak{m}\cong \ker(f_\mathfrak{m})\cong 0$ by assumption. But then by [[Atiyah Localization#^61edfe]] we have $\ker(f) = 0$, and so $f$ is injective. Similarly, for surjectivity we need only show $(3)\implies (1)$. Form the exact sequence $M\to N\to \text{{coker}}(f)\to 0$. At a maximal ideal we have $M_\mathfrak{m}\to N_\mathfrak{m}\to \text{coker}(f)_\mathfrak{m}\to 0$, which is exact, so $\text{coker}(f)_\mathfrak{m} \cong \text{coker}(f_\mathfrak{m}) \cong 0$ by assumption. Applying [[Atiyah Localization#^61edfe]] again we obtain $\text{coker}(f) = 0$, and so $M\to N$ is surjective.
`\end{proof}`
