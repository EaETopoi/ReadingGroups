## Introduction

In these notes we follow Vakil[^1] to define and investigate projective schemes on a formal level similar to that done for affine schemes in other places. These schemes are incredibly important in algebraic geometry and beyond, and in fact many are either projective or open subsets thereof. 

Although projective schemes, like all others, can be obtained by gluing affine schemes, their importance warrants a simpler description in line with that for affine schemes. 

## Projective Schemes

Before beginning let us emphasize the difficulty with only working with the affine gluing perspective.

>[!example]
>Let $\mathbb{P}^n_A$ be projective $n$-space. Let $f_i \in A[x_0,...,x_n]$ be a family of homogeneous polynomials. Then in each affine open $\mathsf{Spec}(A[x_0,...,\hat{x}_i,...,x_n])$ we obtain a family of polynomials obtained by substituting $1$ for $x_i$ which cut out a subscheme $V_i$. Since the $f_i$ are homogeneous we have that $x_i^{\text{deg}(f_i)}f_i(x_1/x_i,...,x_n/x_i) = f(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, so these cutouts are well-defined.


A better algebraic description, which will give us a functor $\mathsf{Proj}$ much like $\mathsf{Spec}$ for affine schemes will be graded rings.

### Interlude on Graded Rings

A ring $R$ is said to be graded over a monoid $N$ if $R = \bigoplus_{n \in N}R_n$ for abelian subgroups $R_n$ of $R$ such that $R_nR_m \subseteq R_{nm}$ for all $n,m \in N$. In particular, $R_e$, for $e$ the identity element in $N$, is always a subring of $R$. In most cases the grading is given by $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{N}$ for the monoid structure given by addition. We say that the elements of $R_n$ in a graded ring $R_\bullet$ are **homogeneous elements** of $R_\bullet$, with non-zero homogeneous elements having a specified degree $n$. An ideal of $R_\bullet$ is said to be a **homogeneous ideal** or **graded ideal** if it is generated by homogeneous elements. $I$ being a homogeneous ideal means it can be decomposed as $I = \bigoplus_{n \in N}I_n$, and so $R_\bullet/I$ has a natural $N$-grading.


We can also localize $R_\bullet$ with respect to multiplicative subsets containing only homogeneous elements.

#### $\mathbb{N}$-Graded Rings

Moving forward we consider $\mathbb{N}$-graded rings. Let $R_\bullet$ be such a ring. We will say $R_\bullet$ is graded over the subring $R_0$, such as is the case for polynomial rings, and we will say that $R_0$ is the **base ring**. An important ideal, the **irrelevant ideal**, of a graded ring $R_\bullet$ is given by $$R_+ := \bigoplus_{i > 0}R_i$$
We say that $R_\bullet$ is a **finitely generated graded ring over $R_0$** if $R_+$ is a finitely generated ideal of $R_\bullet$. If $S_\bullet$ is generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0$-algebra, we say that $S_\bullet$ is **generated in degree $1$**. 

>[!proposition] Finitely Generated Graded Rings
>$R_\bullet$ is a finitely generated graded ring over $R_0$ if and only if $R_\bullet$ is a finitely generated graded $R_0$-algebra. (i.e. $R_\bullet$ is generated over $R_0$ by a finite number of homogeneous elements of positive degree).

^d9753a

`\begin{proof}`
To start let $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of homogeneous generators of $R_+$ as an ideal. Then if $f \in R_+$, we can write $f = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}f_n$ where $f_n$ is the degree $n$ homogeneous piece of $f$, and only finitely many such pieces are non-zero. Then for each $n \geq 1$ there exists $a_{n,i_{n,1}},...,a_{n,i_{n,k_n}} \in R_0$ such that $f_n = \sum_{j=1}^{k_n}a_{n,i_{n,j}}x_{i_{n,j}}$. Thus, $f = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\sum_{j=1}^{k_n}a_{n,i_{n,j}}x_{i_{n,j}}$. It follows that $R_\bullet$ is generated as a graded $R_0$-algebra by the same generators as $R_+$ as an ideal. Thus, if $R_\bullet$ is a finitely generated graded ring over $R_0$, then $R_\bullet$ is a finitely generated graded $R_0$-algebra.

On the other hand, suppose $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$ is a set of homogeneous generators of $R_\bullet$ as a graded $R_0$-algebra. Then $\{x_i\}_{i \in I,\deg x_i > 0}$ forms a generating set of $R_+$ as an ideal, which implies the reverse implication.
`\end{proof}`

>[!proposition] Graded Noetherian Ring
>A graded ring $R_\bullet$ is Noetherian if and only if $R_0$ is Noetherian and $R_\bullet$ is a finitely generated graded ring.

`\begin{proof}`
Since $R_0$ is a subring of $R_\bullet$ it is Noetherian whenever $R_\bullet$. Further, if $R_\bullet$ is Noetherian the necessarily $R_+$ is a finitely generated ideal. On the other hand, if $R_+$ is finitely generated and $R_0$ is Noetherian, then $R_\bullet$ being a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra by [[Projective Schemes#^d9753a]] is Noetherian by Hilbert's Basis Theorem and the fact that quotients of Noetherian rings are Noetherian.
`\end{proof}`

## The $\mathsf{Proj}$ Construction

Let $\mathsf{Gr}_M$ be the category of $M$-graded rings with $M$ a monoid, and a morphism of $M$-graded rings being a ring homomorphism $f:R_\bullet\to S_\bullet$ such that $f(R_m) \subseteq S_m$ for all $m \in M$.

We wish to define a functor $\mathsf{Proj}:\mathsf{Gr}_\mathbb{N}^{op}\to \mathsf{Sch}$. To start, fix an $\mathbb{N}$-graded ring $R_\bullet$. Note that for each homogeneous $f \in R_+$, the localization $(R_\bullet)_f$ is naturally $\mathbb{Z}$-graded where $\deg(1/f) = -\deg(f)$. We drop the bullet moving forward for ease of notation. Let $(R_f)_0$ denote the $0$-graded piece of the graded ring $R_f$. As a set let $\mathsf{Proj}(R_\bullet)$ consist of all **relevant homogeneous prime ideals** $R_\bullet$, which consist of all homogeneous prime ideals not containing $R_+$. 

>[!proposition] Homogeneous Prime Ideal Correpsondence
>If $A$ is $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ring and $f$ is an invertible homogeneous element of positive degree, then there is a bijection between prime ideals of $A_0$ and homogeneous prime ideals of $A$.

`\begin{proof}`
For any (homogeneous) prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ we naturally obtain a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}\cap A_0$ in $A_0$. On the other hand, let $\mathfrak{p}_0$ be an ideal of $A_0$. Define $\mathfrak{p}$ as the direct sum over $Q_i$, where $Q_i\subseteq A_i$ is given by all elements $a \in A_i$ such that $a^{\deg f}/f^i \in \mathfrak{p}_0$. In particular, $Q_0 = \mathfrak{p}_0$. Now, $a \in Q_i$ if and only if $a^{\deg f}/f^i \in \mathfrak{p}_0$, if and only if $a^{n\deg f}/f^{ni} \in \mathfrak{p}_0$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (since $\mathfrak{p}_0$ is prime), if and only if $a^n \in Q_{ni}$ for some (and hence all) $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

Now, if $a_1,a_2 \in Q_i$ we have that $a_1^{\deg f}/f^i,a_2^{\deg f}/f^i \in \mathfrak{p}_0$. Observe that 
$$
\begin{align*}
(a_1^2+2a_1a_2+a_2^2)^{\deg f}/f^{2i} &= \sum_{j=0}^{\deg f}\sum_{k=0}^{\deg f-j}n_{j,k}a_1^{2i}(2a_1a_2)^{j}a_2^{2(\deg f-i-j)}/f^{2i} \\
&=\sum_{j=0}^{\deg f}\sum_{k=0}^{\deg f-j}2^jn_{j,k}a_1^{2i+j}a_2^{2(\deg f-i-j)+j}/f^{2i}
\end{align*}
$$
For all $j,k$, either $2i+j \geq \deg f$ or $2(\deg f-i-j)+j \geq \deg f$, so each summand can be written as $a_i^{\deg f}/f^i\cdot a$ where $a \in A_0$, so the whole sum is in $\mathfrak{p}_0$. From our previous observations $a_1+a_2 \in Q_i$, so each $Q_i$ is an abelian subgroup, and hence so is $\mathfrak{p}$. By construction $\mathfrak{p}$ will be homogeneous if we can prove it is an ideal. But this is clear since for any $a \in Q_i$ and any homogeneous element $b \in A$ of degree $j$, $(ba)^{\deg f}/f^{i+j} = b^{\deg f}/f^j\cdot a^{\deg f}/f^i \in \mathfrak{p}_0$ since $\mathfrak{p}_0$ is an ideal. Hence we have that $\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous ideal.

Finally, we must show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime. Since it is homogeneous it suffices to show that it is prime with respect to homogeneous elements. Let $a \in A_i$ and $b \in A_j$ such that $ab \in Q_{i+j}$. Then $b^{\deg f}/f^j\cdot a^{\deg f}/f^i \in \mathfrak{p}_0$, so as $\mathfrak{p}_0$ is prime either $b^{\deg f}/f^j$ or $a^{\deg f}/f^i$ is in $\mathfrak{p}_0$. Hence, either $a \in Q_i \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ or $b \in Q_j \subseteq\mathfrak{p}$. In general consider $f = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}f_n$ and $g = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}g_n$ such that $fg = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}\sum_{p+q=n}f_pg_q \in \mathfrak{p}$. Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous ideal we have that 
$$\sum_{p+q=n}f_pg_q \in \mathfrak{p}$$
for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
