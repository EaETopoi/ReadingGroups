## Introduction

In these notes we collect viewpoints on teaching from Dr. - from a cross lecture during the 2024 PCMI summer school.

## Four Step method
1. I
2. You (singular)
3. You (plural)
4. We
The I is the lecturer/teacher of the class. The goal of the I is to give an overview of the subject, why a topic in class is being covered, how that topic fits into the context of the wider course, and possibly in mathematics more broadly. The goal is to be able to convey to the students the big picture. (e.g. provide an overview that motivates the lecture/course)

You (singular), the student, reviews the material after class. You (plural) involves discussion between students in study groups, and attempting to show each other.

Finally, the We is closer to a flipped classroom. The We is the students, professor, TA(s), all getting together in things like TA/workshop sessions, office hours, etc.
